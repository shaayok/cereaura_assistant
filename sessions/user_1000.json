Knowing what is supported by evidence helps you make safe, healthy choices for your child.\n<br><b>Step-by-step guide:</b>\n<ol>\n  <li><b>Balanced nutrition first:</b> There is no scientific consensus that any specific diet ‚Äútreats‚Äù autism. The most important goal is a balanced, nutritious diet that supports your child‚Äôs growth and health.</li>\n  <li><b>Food sensitivities:</b> Some children with autism may have food allergies, intolerances, or sensitivities (such as to dairy or gluten). If you notice clear reactions (tummy upset, rashes, behavioral changes) after certain foods, consult your pediatrician or a dietitian before making changes.</li>\n  <li><b>Popular diets:</b> Diets like gluten-free/casein-free (GFCF) are sometimes tried by families, but research shows mixed results. These diets are not recommended for all children and should only be done with professional guidance to avoid nutritional deficiencies.</li>\n  <li><b>Offer choices:</b> According to the WHO and CereAura Data.pdf, offering your child choices at mealtimes (what to eat, how food is presented) can increase motivation, communication, and independence‚Äîeven if they are picky eaters.</li>\n  <li><b>Address picky eating:</b> Many autistic children have strong food preferences or aversions due to sensory sensitivities. Gentle exposure, patience, and involving your child in food choices and preparation can help broaden their diet over time.</li>\n  <li><b>Consult professionals:</b> Always talk to your child‚Äôs doctor or a registered dietitian before starting any restrictive diet, supplements, or major changes. They can help you ensure your child gets all the nutrients they need.</li>\n</ol>\n<b>Friendly tip:</b> Celebrate small wins‚Äîif your child tries a new food or helps choose a snack, that‚Äôs progress! Involving them in shopping or meal prep can make food more fun and less stressful.\n<br><b>üìö References & Resources:</b>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/family-resources.html\" target=\"_blank\">CDC Family Resources</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240055986\" target=\"_blank\">WHO Guidelines on Parent-Mediated Autism Interventions</a></li>\n  <li>CereAura Data.pdf</li>\n</ul>\nThis is guidance, not diagnosis.

For autistic children, social skills often need to be taught step-by-step, with patience and encouragement.\n<br><b>Step-by-step guide:</b>\n<ol>\n  <li><b>Start with side-by-side play:</b> Encourage your child to play with their own toy while sitting near a peer. This reduces pressure and helps your child get comfortable around others. (<i>CereAura Data.pdf</i>)</li>\n  <li><b>Model social behaviors:</b> Silently or subtly show actions like smiling, waving, or using a toy playfully. Your child can learn a lot just by watching you interact.</li>\n  <li><b>Praise small steps:</b> If your child observes or imitates a peer‚Äîeven just watching or copying‚Äîgive gentle praise. (‚ÄúI saw you hand the block to your friend‚Äîgreat sharing!‚Äù)</li>\n  <li><b>Introduce simple interactions:</b> Gradually encourage your child to share a toy, hand an item to a peer, or take turns. Keep these interactions short and positive.</li>\n  <li><b>Expand to group play:</b> Include siblings, peers, or caregivers in play to help your child generalize new skills beyond one-on-one sessions.</li>\n  <li><b>Use positive reinforcement:</b> Consistently praise or reward your child for any effort to connect, share, or play with others. This strengthens social behaviors. (Tip 36, <i>CereAura Data.pdf</i>)</li>\n  <li><b>Repeat and build:</b> Practice these steps daily or several times a week. Gradually increase the length and complexity of play as your child‚Äôs comfort grows.</li>\n  <li><b>Observe and adapt:</b> Watch what works best for your child and adjust activities to keep them engaged and successful.</li>\n</ol>\n<b>Friendly tip:</b> ‚ÄúSide-by-side is the first step to togetherness!

This preference is a well-documented part of autism (DSM-5: insistence on sameness, restricted patterns) and is not ‚Äúbad‚Äù or unusual. Structured routines help your child feel secure, reduce stress, and support emotional regulation and learning (Odom et al., 2010; WHO recommendations).\n<br><b>Step-by-step guide:</b>\n<ol>\n  <li><b>Map out routines:</b> Identify and write down your child‚Äôs key daily activities‚Äîmorning, meals, play, therapy, bedtime. Consistency in these areas provides comfort and predictability.</li>\n  <li><b>Use visual or verbal cues:</b> Show the schedule with pictures, charts, or simple verbal prompts to reinforce what‚Äôs coming next.</li>\n  <li><b>Introduce routines gradually:</b> Start with the most important routines, teaching one at a time until your child is comfortable.</li>\n  <li><b>Be consistent:</b> Try to do activities in the same order each day. This builds your child‚Äôs confidence and reduces anxiety.</li>\n  <li><b>Prepare for transitions:</b> Give advance warnings before changing activities (e.g., ‚ÄúIn 5 minutes, we will clean up‚Äù). This helps your child anticipate and adjust to changes.</li>\n  <li><b>Reinforce success:</b> Praise your child for completing routines or handling changes, even small ones (‚ÄúGreat job finishing your morning routine all by yourself!‚Äù).</li>\n  <li><b>Adjust when needed:</b> Life isn‚Äôt always predictable.
