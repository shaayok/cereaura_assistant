Healthy boundaries help your child benefit from technology while protecting their development.\n\n<b>Step-by-step guide:</b>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Follow expert recommendations:</b> The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests no more than 1‚Äì2 hours of recreational screen time per day for children ages 6 and up, with a focus on high-quality, educational content.</li>\n<li><b>Use structured routines:</b> Establish clear ‚Äúscreen time windows‚Äù (e.g., after homework, before dinner) and stick to them. Predictable routines help your child know what to expect.</li>\n<li><b>Incorporate frequent, predictable breaks:</b> As highlighted in the CereAura Data, use structured activity-rest cycles. For example, ‚Äú20 minutes of screen time, then a 5-minute movement break.‚Äù Timers and visuals can help manage transitions. [[image:screen_time_timer]]</li>\n<li><b>Offer alternatives:</b> Encourage non-screen activities during breaks, such as stretching, reading, drawing, or playing with toys. Give your child choices to build independence and motivation.</li>\n<li><b>Monitor for signs of overload:</b> Watch for stress signals like irritability, refusal to stop, or trouble transitioning away from screens. If you notice these, shorten sessions and offer calming alternatives.</li>\n<li><b>Model healthy habits:</b> Show your child that you also take breaks from screens and enjoy other activities as a family.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<b>Friendly tip:</b> ‚ÄúTimers and visuals are your friends!
