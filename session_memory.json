Children with autism often have heightened sensitivity to changes, unpredictability, or sensory overload (DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association, 2013).<br><br>WHO and CDC recommend structured environments as part of effective parent-mediated interventions.<br><br> <b>Why it matters:</b><br>Sudden changes, loud noises, or cluttered spaces can trigger distress, meltdowns, or avoidance behaviors in children with autism.

Creating predictability helps children anticipate what comes next, reduces anxiety, and supports engagement in therapy or learning activities (Klin et al., 2007). Structured routines also foster independence.<br><br> <b>Step-by-step guide:</b><br>1. Establish daily routines: set consistent times for waking, meals, therapy, play, bedtime. Use visual schedules.<br>2. Organize spaces: designate clear areas for specific activities.<br>3. Minimize sensory overload: calm colors, soft lighting, reduced noise/clutter.<br>4. Prepare for transitions: give warnings, use timers or countdowns.<br>5. Use consistent cues: pair verbal instructions with visual/tactile cues.<br>6. Offer choices within limits: let your child pick between two options.<br>7. Introduce change gradually: make small, incremental adjustments.<br>8.
